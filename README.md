1. Bubblesort<br>
    sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps<br>
  through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the<br>
  wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.<br>
