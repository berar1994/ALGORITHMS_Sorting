# How to import in Eclipse
 - create folder on a desired location<br>
 - clone the repository in this folder<br>
 - open Eclipse -> File -> New -> Java Project<br>
 - uncheck the 'Use default location' box and browse for your created folder<br>
 - Eclipse is smart enough to know how to create a project from src folder<br>
 - Click 'Finish'<br>
 - set Java compiler to JDK 1.8 <br>

# Algorithms description
1. Bubble sort<br>
    * sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps<br>
  through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the<br>
  wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.<br>
2. Insertion sort<br>
    * insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. Each iteration,<br>
    * insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts<br>
    it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.<br>
3. Quick sort<br>
    * is a divide and conquer algorithm; first divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements<br> 
    * recursively sort the sub-arrays.<br>
4. Merge sort<br>
    * divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted)<br>
    * repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list<br>
