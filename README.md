# How to import in Eclipse
 - create folder on a desired location  
 - clone the repository in this folder  
 - open Eclipse -> File -> New -> Java Project  
 - uncheck the 'Use default location' box and browse for your created folder  
 - Eclipse is smart enough to know how to create a project from src folder  
 - Click 'Finish'  
 - set Java compiler to JDK 1.8  

# Algorithms description
1. Bubble sort  
    * sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps  
  through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the  
  wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.  
2. Insertion sort  
    * insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. Each iteration,  
    * insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts  
    it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.  
3. Quick sort  
    * is a divide and conquer algorithm; first divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements  
    * recursively sort the sub-arrays.  
4. Merge sort  
    * divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted)  
    * repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list  
5. Shell sort  
    * starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other  
    * then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared  
    * the idea is to arrange the list of elements so that, starting anywhere, considering every hth element gives a sorted list
