# How to import in Eclipse
 - create folder on a desired location<br>
 - clone the repository<br>
 - open Eclipse -> File -> New -> Java Project<br>
 - uncheck the 'Use default location' box and browse for your created folder<br>
 - Eclipse is smart enough to know how to create a project from src folder<br>
 - Click 'Finish'<br>
 - set Java compiler to JDK 1.8 <br>

# Algorithms description
1. Bubble sort<br>
    sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps<br>
  through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the<br>
  wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.<br>
2. Insertion sort<br>
    Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. Each iteration,<br>
    insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts<br>
    it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.<br>
